    <p style="text-align:justify">Since 1998, Vineyard (previously known as Funcity) has given hundreds of users the opportunity to run their own
      online services. Our goal is to
      offer shell accounts to people who may not have access to one otherwise. With this shell account, users can create
      MUDs, talkers, web pages, or many other online applications. If you have any questions regarding our service or
      are interested in a free account, please don't hesitate to
      <script language="JavaScript">
        var username = "hostme";
        var hostname = "vineyard.haus";
        var linktext = "write to us";
        document.write("<a href='" + "mail" + "to:" + username + "@" + hostname + "'>" + linktext + "</a>");
      </script>.</p>
